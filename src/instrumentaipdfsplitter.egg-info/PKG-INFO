# Instrument AI PDF Splitter

A lightweight Python tool that uses OpenAI to analyze multi-page sheet-music PDFs, detect instrument parts (including voice/desk numbers), determine their page ranges, and split the source PDF into one file per instrument/voice.

- AI-assisted part detection: extracts instruments, voice numbers, and 1-indexed start/end pages as strict JSON.
- Smart uploads: avoids re-uploading identical files via SHA-256 hashing.
- **File size validation**: automatically validates files don't exceed 32MB before processing.
- **Direct URL support**: pass file URLs directly to OpenAI without uploading.
- Reliable splitting: clamps page ranges, sanitizes filenames, and writes outputs using pypdf.
- Flexible input: use AI analysis or provide your own instrument list (InstrumentPart or JSON).
- Configurable model: via constructor or OPENAI_MODEL env var; requires an OpenAI API key.

## Installation

```bash
pip install instrumentaipdfsplitter
```

Requirements:
- Python 3.10+
- openai (>= 1.0.0)
- pypdf
- dataclasses (builtin)
- typing, pathlib, etc. (builtin)

## Quickstart

```python
import os
import json
from InstrumentAiPdfSplitter import InstrumentAiPdfSplitter, FileSizeExceededError

# Set your OpenAI API key via env or pass directly
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

splitter = InstrumentAiPdfSplitter(api_key=api_key)

# 1) Analyze the PDF to get instrument parts and page ranges
# Use pdf_path for local files or URLs
data = splitter.analyse(pdf_path="scores/book.pdf")
print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))

# Example output (JSON):
# {
#   "instruments": [
#     {"name": "Trumpet in Bb", "voice": "1", "start_page": 3, "end_page": 5},
#     {"name": "Alto Sax", "voice": null, "start_page": 6, "end_page": 9}
#   ]
# }

# 2) Split the PDF into one file per instrument/voice
results = splitter.split_pdf(pdf_path="scores/book.pdf")
for r in results:
    print(f"{r['name']} {r['voice']} -> {r['output_path']} [{r['start_page']}-{r['end_page']}]")

# 3) Using file URLs (for already uploaded files)
data = splitter.analyse(file_url="https://example.com/score.pdf")
print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
```

### One-liner

If you just want to analyse and split in one go:

```python
results = splitter.analyse_and_split(pdf_path="scores/book.pdf")
```

### Single-part analysis (extract instrument and voice)

If your PDF contains a single instrument part and you only want to extract its information:

```python
info = splitter.analyse_single_part(pdf_path="scores/trumpet1.pdf")
print(info)
# Example: {"name": "Trumpet in Bb", "voice": "1", "start_page": 1, "end_page": 3, "pages": 3}

# Or use a file URL
info = splitter.analyse_single_part(file_url="https://example.com/trumpet.pdf")
```

By default, output files are saved into a sibling directory named "<stem>_parts" (e.g., book_parts).
To change the output location, pass `out_dir`.
To avoid writing to disk entirely and get the split PDFs back as in-memory bytes, set `return_files=True`:

```python
# Return split PDFs without writing them to disk
results = splitter.split_pdf(pdf_path="scores/book.pdf", return_files=True)
for r in results:
    print(r["filename"], len(r["content"]))  # content is bytes for the PDF

# One-liner variant
results = splitter.analyse_and_split(pdf_path="scores/book.pdf", return_files=True)
```

### File size validation and error handling

Files are automatically validated to ensure they don't exceed 32MB:

```python
try:
    data = splitter.analyse(pdf_path="large_file.pdf")
except FileSizeExceededError as e:
    print(f"File too large: {e}")
    # Output: File size (45.32 MB) exceeds maximum allowed size of 32 MB
```

### Using file URLs instead of uploading

If you have a file already accessible via URL (e.g., from a CDN or OpenAI), you can pass it directly without uploading:

```python
# Analyze using a file URL
data = splitter.analyse(file_url="https://example.com/score.pdf")

# Analyze single part using a file URL
info = splitter.analyse_single_part(file_url="https://files.openai.com/file-abc123")

# Note: split_pdf and analyse_and_split require pdf_path (local file) since they need to read pages
```

**Important**: Methods accept **either** `pdf_path` **or** `file_url`, but not both. Providing both will raise a `ValueError`.

## Manual instrument data (no AI call)

You can skip analysis and provide parts manually, either as InstrumentPart instances or JSON-like dicts.

```python
from InstrumentAiPdfSplitter import InstrumentAiPdfSplitter, InstrumentPart, FileSizeExceededError

splitter = InstrumentAiPdfSplitter(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

parts = [
    InstrumentPart(name="Trumpet in Bb", voice="1", start_page=3, end_page=5),
    {"name": "Alto Sax", "voice": None, "start_page": 6, "end_page": 9},  # JSON-like dict also works
]

results = splitter.split_pdf(
    pdf_path="scores/book.pdf",
    instruments_data=parts,
    out_dir="output/parts"  # optional custom directory
)

for r in results:
    print(r)
```

## Configuration

- API key: Provide via constructor or set OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment.
- Model: Pass `model` to the constructor or set `OPENAI_MODEL`; defaults to "gpt-5".

```python
splitter = InstrumentAiPdfSplitter(api_key="...", model="gpt-5")
```

Note: Model availability depends on your OpenAI account. Use a model that supports the Responses API with file inputs. You will get the best results with gpt-5.

## How it works

- Content-hash uploads: Files are uploaded once per SHA-256; duplicates are skipped.
- AI analysis: The PDF and a strict prompt are sent to OpenAI; output is parsed as JSON.
- Splitting:
  - Ensures pages are 1-indexed and within document bounds.
  - Swaps start/end if reversed.
  - Sanitizes output filenames (removes unsafe characters).
  - Writes per-part PDFs using pypdf.

## Public API

|| Item | Signature | Description |
||------|-----------|-------------|
|| FileSizeExceededError | Exception | Raised when a file exceeds the 32MB size limit. |
|| InstrumentPart | name: str; voice: Optional[str]; start_page: int; end_page: int | Dataclass representing a single instrument part with optional voice and 1-indexed inclusive page range. |
|| InstrumentAiPdfSplitter.__init__ | (api_key: str, *, model: str \| None = None) -> None | Initialize the splitter with OpenAI credentials and default prompt. |
|| InstrumentAiPdfSplitter.analyse | (pdf_path: Union[str, FileStorage, None] = None, file_url: Optional[str] = None) -> dict | Analyze a PDF and return instrument data as JSON {instruments: [...]}. Use either pdf_path or file_url, not both. |
|| InstrumentAiPdfSplitter.analyse_and_split | (pdf_path: Union[str, FileStorage, None] = None, out_dir: Optional[str] = None, *, return_files: bool = False, file_url: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]] | Convenience: analyse then split in one call; set return_files=True to get in-memory PDFs. Requires pdf_path (not file_url). |
|| InstrumentAiPdfSplitter.analyse_single_part | (pdf_path: Union[str, FileStorage, None] = None, file_url: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any] | Analyse a single-part PDF and extract instrument name and optional voice; returns also start/end/pages. Use either pdf_path or file_url, not both. |
|| InstrumentAiPdfSplitter.is_file_already_uploaded | (pdf_path: Union[str, FileStorage]) -> Tuple[bool, str] \| Tuple[bool] | Check if a file (by SHA-256) is already uploaded; returns (True, file_id) or (False,). |
|| InstrumentAiPdfSplitter.split_pdf | (pdf_path: Union[str, FileStorage, None] = None, instruments_data: List[InstrumentPart] \| Dict[str, Any] \| None = None, out_dir: Optional[str] = None, *, return_files: bool = False, file_url: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]] | Split the PDF per instrument/voice. Returns on-disk metadata (output_path) or in-memory (filename, content bytes) when return_files=True. Requires pdf_path (not file_url). |
|| InstrumentAiPdfSplitter.file_hash | (path: str) -> str | Compute SHA-256 hex digest of a file's contents. |

## Error handling

- **FileSizeExceededError**: File exceeds 32MB size limit.
- **ValueError**: Invalid parameters (e.g., both pdf_path and file_url provided, or neither provided).
- **FileNotFoundError**: Path doesn't exist.
- **ValueError**: Not a file or not a .pdf.
- **json.JSONDecodeError**: If AI output isn't valid JSON (rare; retry or adjust model).
- **OpenAI errors**: Network/auth/model issues are propagated from the OpenAI SDK.

## Tips for best results

- Use clear, well-structured PDFs with visible instrument headers or page titles.
- If AI is uncertain, manually provide `instruments_data` for precise splitting.
- Verify the model supports file inputs in your region/account.
- Handle sensitive material carefully; PDFs are uploaded to OpenAI for analysis.

## Development

```bash
# Clone and install locally
git clone REPO_URL
cd REPO_DIR
pip install -e .

# Run a quick test (adjust paths)
python -c "from InstrumentAiPdfSplitter import InstrumentAiPdfSplitter; import os; s=InstrumentAiPdfSplitter(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')); print(s.file_hash('scores/book.pdf'))"
```

## Versioning and compatibility

- Tested with Python 3.10+.
- Requires openai>=1.0.0 and pypdf. Keep dependencies updated.

## FAQ

- Does it require internet?
  - Yes, for AI analysis. Splitting runs locally.
- Can I prevent re-uploads?
  - Yes. The tool checks a SHA-256 content hash against your uploaded files.
- Is the output deterministic?
  - The JSON structure is deterministic; the content depends on model interpretation.
